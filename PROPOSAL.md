
P!nkSwap Proposal
===================================
A substrate chain with fully function of AMM swap and govanence.
## Proposal description
 An overall description.
 - Feature
>  1. Pricing for Parathread native token.
>  2. New DOT to be the first pricing token to any other token as the position of BTC in any other CEX. 
>  After the PINKSWAP deployed and run for a well with stable performance, the PINK token will be introduced.
>  3. Increasing Paras (Parachain and Parathread) native token swap.
>  4. Decentralized Liquidity Providing, we say the de-AMM natively on Polkadot.
 - Initialtive
>   A AMM bonding curve will be applied and will be improved as community developing. 

## System Overview

As all we have seen and engaged these days about DEFI and AMM platform in Ethereum ecosystem, they are the great breakthrough in DEX, we thought which is the exactly the one point that Polkadot is designed to and natively compatible of.

>  So we are trying to design a mechanism on Polkadot which somehow like uniswap on Ethereum, which is aiming on 3 targets as follows:

>1)	Pricing for Parathread native token.
>Polkadot gives the change of any chain which is willing to be secured by DOT being able to temporarily participate (on a block by block basis) in Polkadot security without needing to lease a dedicated parachain slot. In this case, the Collators to determine which Parathreadâ€™s block will be collected on a per block basis by the values of the collected Parathread native tokens if they have.
Collators must then submit block candidates with an associated bid in DOT. This means that if the parathread offers a local currency, the collator will need to understand the exchange rate between this currency and DOT in order to place a proper DOT bid on the Relay Chain and ensure that they make a profit.
>PINKSWAP will provide the service firstly for the Collators to swap the Paras native token to DOT or only read the exact price at the time when they are willing to. Noted here is the price will be with potential liquidity like the uniswap provided, which means the tokens could be swapped on the price indicated with the amount that AMMer provided. If do so, no need external price feed.
And further more, the pricing model will also be used as a assessment way or ground rule to select the parathread which may possible to be a parachain.
>2)	Paras (Parachain and Parathread) native token swap.
Along with the first target to be realized, the second one for other users to swap amoung Paras Native Tokens will also be realized at the same time.
>3)	Decentralized Liquidity Providing, we say the de-AMM natively on Polkadot.
This part will almost the same of uniswap provided for ethereum.

Basically, the 3 targets above is the goal for PINKSWAP to provide and achive.
Token ticker: PINK
The AMM bonding curve could be upgraded based on PINK token holder.
Trading fees will be paid on any token that the liquidity provider intented to use. Primarily would be New DOT. Gas fees will be paid on New DOT.

## Deliverables


## Roadmap and Milestones
1. Run a demo POC in polkadot
2. Setup the UI and public
3. Adding new feature
4. Make as parachain KSM
5. introduce a token PINK

## Total Budget Requested


## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans


## Team members


## Future
> To provide common framwork
> to provide bonding curve
> service parathread token and extention
> To join and welcome more ecosystem


 Which will be another way to capture the value of New DOT. The second pricing token may possible be any New DOT backed stable coin created by any other team. And after the PINKSWAP deployed and run for a well with stable performance, the PINK token will be introduced.
